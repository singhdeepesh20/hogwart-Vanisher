Turn your camera into a real-life invisibility cloak using OpenCV + Streamlit.
This demo replaces a selected cloak color (red/blue/white/black) with the captured background, creating a magical invisibility effect — inspired by Harry Potter’s cloak! ✨

🚀 Features

* Capture background frame (empty scene).

* Step into the frame holding your chosen cloak.

* Supports multiple cloak colors (white, black, red, blue).

* Real-time background replacement effect.

* Interactive Streamlit web app interface.

🖥️ How to Use

* Open the app in your browser (http://localhost:8501).

* Stand out of the frame and click Capture Background.

* Step into frame holding your chosen cloak color:

⚪ White cloth/paper


The app will replace cloak area with the captured background → making it look invisible.
